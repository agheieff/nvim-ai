Making an AI Plugin for nvim, because the one I wanted didn’t work for me.

## For now
- Only supports Claude
- Only supports taking everything before cursor as input and writing the output after the cursor.

## Plans for development
- Add other APIs — OpenAI,and others
- Option to replace the selection and send it as input
- Option to chat in a separate window
- Rolling input — for now the plugin has to wait for the message to end to input it all at once.

## How to install
I don’t know, I’ll do something when I have time to figure this stuff out. For now, you just get the lua script.

For any questions, contact me at agheieff@pm.me.
